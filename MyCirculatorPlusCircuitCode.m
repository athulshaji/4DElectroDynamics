function MyCirculatorPlusCircuitCode
% A transmission line of a fixed characteristic impedance is connected to a
% 3-port circulator with port impedances of 50 Ohms. The circuit (either
% linear or non-linear is connected to the port 2 of the circulator. The
% circuit considered in this problem is the half wave rectifier (HWR) --.
% series diode and shunt capacitance and shunt resistor. The voltage
% across the shunt elements are provided to the port 1 of the second
% circulator. Port 3 of both the circulators are connected to the resistors
% of 50 Ohms (termination by matched load). Port 2 of the second circulator
% is terminated in 50 ohms impedance.
