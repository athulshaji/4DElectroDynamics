This repo contains MATLAB codes which I had developed to study the effects of harmonics on the working of electronic circuits. This is still in the development stage. Please feel free to download the code and experiment with it. In case of any programming or logical error please contact me:  athul.shaji1729@gmail.com. This will help me to understand my mistakes and learn.
